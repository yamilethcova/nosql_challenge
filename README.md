Part 2: Update database by adding a new halal restaurant "Penang Flavours," finding and updating BusinessTypeID, removing establishments in Dover Local Authority, and converting data types.
Part 3: Perform exploratory analysis on the database, answering questions using count_documents, pprint, and Pandas DataFrame. Topics include hygiene score, London establishments with high ratings, top-rated establishments near "Penang Flavours," and counting hygiene scores in each Local Authority area.
